!     Calculate the areas of the cells and store in g%area. The area of any
!     quadrilateral is half of the magnitude of the cross product of the two
!     vectors that form the diagonals. Check the order of your product so that
!     the values come out positive! You can do this using two nested loops in
!     the i and j-directions or in a vectorised way by indexing the coordinate
!     arrays with lists of indices

!     Calculate the projected lengths in the x and y-directions on all of the
!     "i = const" facets and store them in g%lx_i and g%ly_i. When combined
!     together these two components define a vector that is normal to the facet,
!     pointing inwards towards the centre of the cell. This is only the case for
!     the left hand side of the cell, the vector stored in position i,j points
!     towards the centre of the i,j cell

!     Find the minimum length scale in the mesh, this is defined as the length
!     of the shortest side of all the cells. Call this length "l_min", it is used
!     to set the timestep from the CFL number. Start by calculating the lengths
!     of the i and j facets by using the intrinsic function "hypot", this avoids
!     underflow and overflow errors. Then find the overal minimum value using
!     both the "min" and "minval" functions.
